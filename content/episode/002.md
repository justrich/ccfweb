### Episode summary:

In the first part of the story Krystal recounts her journey to Madison, Wisconsin
to judge at the 2023 CrossFit Games and tick off a significant bucket list item.

We'll learn about a serendipitous chance meeting during a long airport layover
that would set the stage for some memorable moments throughout the course of
the coming weekend; what it takes to be successful as a CrossFit
judge at the highest level in the sport, and how that differs from judging
at a local and affiliate level, what a typical day for the volunteer judging 
teams looks like, and some unexpected surprises judging the first event.
