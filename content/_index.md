Cancer and Crossfit is a podcast hosted by Krystal and Rich.  

The benefits of physical activity and strength training for cancer patients
have been well documented.

Our podcast hopes to help de-stigmatise cancer and provide some insight into
the benefits we have discovered through our Crossfit community as we navigate
our health challenges.
