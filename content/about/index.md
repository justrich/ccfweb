Cancer and CrossFit is a podcast hosted by Krystal and Rich.

The benefits of physical activity and strength training for cancer patients 
have been well documented.

Our podcast hopes to help de-stigmatise cancer and provide some insight into 
the benefits we have discovered through our Crossfit community as we navigate 
our health challenges.

We hope to educate and inspire others who may be facing similar health 
challenges and inject some humor and humanity into what are often considered
taboo topics:  Cancer, death and dying.

Episodes are released semi-regularly on no fixed schedule so be sure to
subscribe to the podcast on your platform of choice.
